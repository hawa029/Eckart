# THE ECKART PROJECT

* The Eckart Project comes from a simple desir to produce a full-website with Html, CSS and Javascript contains. 
It's about a compagny who provides services and assistance for others compagnies around the world

## Such an exercise

* First of all, it's an exercise. Throw this, i've found an other way to pratice all I learn as acknowledge in development. 
There are so many things to try and the only thing that could stop you it's the creativity. I hope that' will lead me forward.

## Contains text and images

* As you can see, Eckart is just a name that comes from imagination. There is not really a meaning or particular sens. Most part of 
contains is made of Lorem ipsum. Just the title and some section, articles got a real word. That's make a little bit serious :-)

## Materials and languages

* Html
- Even it's not a programming language, HTML is part of a website. We need it haha... :-P 

* CSS 
It could happen that we find CSS not interessing. But, since I began learning I found on the internet most creations full made with only css !! OMG, there are so much functionalities in these language. To use all of these we will need many years... Some stylesheets have more than one thousand lines. In this project, I will try all I need and hope more.

* Javascript

For sure, I began this project for it. I don't know for the moment someting in PHP, Java, C#, Python, etc... I spent the last weeks on learning JS and his framework. So now, i will put some little code on my scripts. That will be for me a great step :-D

* VSCode
Nothing to say about this IDE. You know all :-)

So let's start !

Thanks for coming overthere!
